# Observable Feedback README  

Thank you for taking the time to give us feedback. 

Please [submit your issue](https://github.com/observablehq/feedback/issues/new/choose) and give us as much detail as possible. If the `feature request` or `bug` templates doesn't cover your needs, feel free to open a blank issue. 

After your issue is submitted we will do our best to triage it in a **[project board](https://github.com/observablehq/feedback/projects/)** and provide context where needed.

The current flow for our project board is:

  - **Submitted** - All issues waiting for further triage or response. 

  - **On the Roadmap** - Features and improvements we have on our current roadmap. 

  - **Additional Issues** - Not currently scoped in our roadmap. 

  - **Closed**- Closed issue, check the issue for further context. 


See an issue you were planning on submitting? **Give it a üëç as a +1.**

We look forward to your feedback!
